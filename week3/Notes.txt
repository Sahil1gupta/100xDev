#In this week we are studing middleware,ZOD,Global catch

1)Any website have two checks-->1st)Authantication 2nd)Input validation

2)app.use(express.json())
    app.use() takes middleware as argument and call them after every routes....we dont need to explicitly pass the midleware as callback to every routes.
    if we think that any we wrote should be call at every route then pass it within app.use(middleware) it we handle for you.

    express.json() within app.use() ---so commonly it is use for post request. it is use to parse the body and .json() indicates that it will take input (which is coming from post request)  
    in json format. 

    now question arises that why dont  we require express.json() or app.use(express.json())
    at the time of (req.headers.username,req.headers.password,req.query.kidenyid;) bcoz 
    we are aware of what will be coming from get request while talking about body part which is 
    coming via post request we don't know the format of data whether it is text,HTML,JSON or something else
    so to be precise that we want only json data to be passed in body  and parse it in json that's why we are using express.json()


Gloabl catch

ZOD --> For Input validation just give it schema of your field
